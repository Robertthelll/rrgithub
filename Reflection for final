 Which AI tool(s) did you use?
I used ChatGPT as my AI assistant to help generate parts of the landing page. Specifically, ChatGPT provided the structure for the **Hero Section HTML** and the **Hero Section CSS styling**, including the layout, background image usage, and button hover effect.

 How did it help you?
The AI tool helped me speed up the coding process by generating clean, responsive code that I could directly integrate into my project. It provided inspiration for the design layout, saving me time I would have otherwise spent brainstorming and troubleshooting. It also suggested best practices for mobile responsiveness and simple animations.

 What challenges did you encounter?
The biggest challenge was making sure the AI-generated code matched the branding and theme of Robert’s Flame and Grill. I had to edit some of the AI’s suggestions to better fit the business identity and keep the design consistent. Another challenge was ensuring the HTML and CSS worked seamlessly together and looked good across different devices.

 What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?
I learned that AI tools are excellent at providing a starting point and handling repetitive tasks. They help save time and can suggest best practices I might not have considered. However, AI is not perfect—it still requires human oversight to refine the design, customize the branding, and ensure everything functions as intended. This assignment showed me that the best approach is a **collaboration between AI assistance and human creativity**.
